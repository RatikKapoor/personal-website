Throughout my electrical engineering degree, I have learned valuable skills in each course that I can use in the future. As such, I have listed some of my key takeaways from classes that I have taken. This page in particular details my second year, second semester, in the Integrated Learning Stream pilot project. This pilot aims to give students better hands-on skills through a learning environment where lab equipment is readily available and labs are tied into lecture.

One of my key takeaways from this course was how to use a PIC microcontroller. PICs are very similar to Arduinos in that they can be programmed to perform whatever task you want them to perform. What I found the most interesting about PICs is just how low-level they are compared to an Arduino. As such, signal outputs from our programming were surprisingly clean and I have gained new appreciation for these devices. Through our PIC labs, we were able to control LED using a button-triggered sequence. In addition, my group was also successful in generating a sine wave using the PIC's DAC output with a value lookup table.
