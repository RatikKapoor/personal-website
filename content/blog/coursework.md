Throughout my electrical engineering degree, I have learned valuable skills in each course that I can use in the future. As such, I have listed some of my key takeaways from classes that I have taken. This page in particular details my second year, second semester, in the Integrated Learning Stream pilot project. This pilot aims to give students better hands-on skills through a learning environment where lab equipment is readily available and labs are tied into lecture.

**ENEL 369: Computer Organization**

One of my key takeaways from this course was how to use a PIC microcontroller. PICs are very similar to Arduinos in that they can be programmed to perform whatever task you want them to perform. What I found the most interesting about PICs is just how low-level they are compared to an Arduino. As such, signal outputs from our programming were surprisingly clean and I have gained new appreciation for these devices. Through our PIC labs, we were able to control LED using a button-triggered sequence. In addition, my group was also successful in generating a sine wave using the PIC's DAC output with a value lookup table.

**ENEL 327: Signals and Systems**

**ENEL 300: Engineering Professional Skills**

In this course, I learned how to effectively generate ideas and use research methodology top discuss technical topics. I also learned Agile project management methodology, and applying it to create an electronic device to be used by specific customers. 

I particularly found the Agile methodology very useful as it is something I can use in leading the Relectric Car Team. I learned about how sprints work, the product backlog, etc., and applied those skills by acting as the scrum master on our team. As such, I oversaw, and contributed to, four sprints throughout the semester, which resulted in the successful completion of our project. 

As part of this course, our group created a device called PlantPod. The initial goal of this device was to help busy working professionals remember to water their plants by playing a customizable tone when PlantPod detects soil moisture is too low. However, we found similar devices that were slightly cheaper than our design and provided a bit more functionality. In light of this, our group decided to pivot and market PlantPod as a DIY kit targeting young middle-schoolers. We found this to be a better market as many young electronics enthusiasts get their start with small kits like PlantPod. Moreover, most starter kits have limited use after they are built, while PlantPod is still usable long after. We also discovered that Grade 5 students learn about Electronics and Wetlands in their Science class and decided to focus our marketing to this age group.

PlantPod was built using an Arduino Nano with a capacitive soil sensor, speaker, and other small components. This design was meant to be shifted to a PIC microcontroller, however, this could not be completed due to COVID-19 and the transition to online classes.
